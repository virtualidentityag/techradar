Puppeteer,Languages-and-Frameworks,Adopt,TRUE,"<p><strong>Puppeteer</strong> provides an API to control a (headless) Chrome.</p><p>Developers are able to generate screenshots and PDFs of pages, crawl their contents and automate keyboard input, form submission and more.</p><p>Puppeteer can help to automate UI testing and offers some nice-to-have features, which can ease the daily life of developers.</p><p>We use Puppeteer in (at least) two website projects for the processing and rendering of static pages.</p>"
GraphQL,Languages-and-Frameworks,Adopt,TRUE,"<p><strong>GraphQL</strong> is a language for querying databases from client-side applications and offers an alternative to the usage of RESTful APIs.</p><p>Developers are able to make precise data requests and obtain no more and no less, but exactly what they need.</p><p>This reduces network traffic and makes the developer's life easier, since he knows what data he can expect and work with.</p><p>We could already evaluate GraphQL in a strategic project and decided that we can profit from it.</p>"
Node.js,Languages-and-Frameworks,Adopt,TRUE,"<p>dummy</p>"
ES Modules,Languages-and-Frameworks,Assess,TRUE,"<p><strong>ES Modules</strong>: Currently, most of the browsers already support the use of ES modules. And, of course, Node.js couldn’t stay back and now fully supports ECMAScript modules as they are currently specified and provides limited interoperability between them and the existing module format, CommonJS. ECMAScript modules are the official standard format to package JavaScript code for reuse. Modules are defined using a variety of import and export statements.</p><p><strong>Dynamic imports</strong> This feature solves a lot of headaches and waste of money related to the app’s performance. It helps to, and allows to, load modules dynamically. In other words, on-demand by using promises or the async/await syntax</p>"
Web Assembly,Languages-and-Frameworks,Assess,TRUE,"<p><strong>Web Assembly (Wasm)</strong> can reduce quite a bit the battery consumption on mobile devices (depending on the engine), since most of the processing steps have been completed ahead of time during compilation. With Web Assembly, we’ll be able to push some of the heaviest processing and rendering into a language that is better suited for the job.</p><p>The Wasm stack machine is designed to be encoded in a size- and load-time-efficient binary format which may save loading times.</p>"
Houdini,Languages-and-Frameworks,Assess,TRUE,"<p><strong>Houdini</strong> gives developers access to the CSS object model (CSSOM) for the very first time. Instead of updating styles in JavaScript, developers can write code that the browser understands and can parse as CSS!</p>"
Vue.JS,Languages-and-Frameworks,Adopt,FALSE,"<p>Vue is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable.</p>"
React,Languages-and-Frameworks,Adopt,FALSE,"<p>React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.</p>"
Java beyond 8,Languages-and-Frameworks,Trial,TRUE,"<p><strong>Java</strong> is the language of choice for us for building more complex applications or where a traditional Java-based CMS is used.</p><p>Java 8 is already aged but it is still the version we use in most active projects. LTS will eventually run out and we will have to update to more current versions. Besides that many new interresting features were introduced which could help us for simplicity, clarity or effectivness.</p><p>Since we know Java in general very well, we should directly use it in real projects to identify the real pros and cons of post version 8 features</p>"
RxJS,Languages-and-Frameworks,Trial,TRUE,"<p>RxJS is a library for reactive programming using Observables, to make it easier to compose asynchronous or callback-based code.</p>"
Python,Languages-and-Frameworks,Assess,TRUE,"<p><strong>Python</strong> is an established battle tested general purpose programming language which is well known for its clear, simple and concise syntax.</p><p>Python3 gained a lot of traction in the last years because of its strengths in the fields of machine learning and data analysis. One major benefit for us could be the very small footprint for serverless functions and the very fast cold start times compared to Java or node.js.</p><p>We have no experience with the language and should asses it in prototypical projects.</p>"
Jest Testing Framework,Languages-and-Frameworks,Trial,TRUE,"<p><strong>Jest</strong> is an open source Javascript testing framework focusing on simplicity. It works out of the box, is mostly config-free and does not require additional assertion libraries. Jest is used by Facebook for react, but can be used for any JavaScript, Typescript or Nodejs project.</p><p>With Jest it’s easier and faster to write tests than with Mocha and Chai.<p>We could profit from reduced efforts in setting-up and maintaining the testing framework and more efficiently writing tests.</p><p>Jest already is used and proven beneficial in existing VI projects like Neoperl.</p>"
Machine Learning,Techniques,Assess,TRUE,"<p>Machine Learning is on everyone's lips and there are certainly many concrete topics we could note down, but we lack the general knowledge of what we can do with this trend and we are not able to provide information when talking to customers.</p><p>We as VI will probably not develop ML services, but we want to be able to use them.</p><p>For this purpose, a concrete use case would be helpful to get a feeling for the topic and also to be able to give a more confident figure in customer questions.</p>"
Kubernetes,Tools,Adopt,TRUE,"<p><strong>Kubernetes (K8s)</strong> is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.</p><p>It helps us to deploy, manage and automate applications that consist of a set of services. Without this support and automation, managing containerized applications becomes more difficult the more services the application contains.</p><p>We successfully use Kubernetes in projects. A migration to Kubernetes is currently being carried out for one of our biggest platforms.We therefore intend to use Kubernetes in principle for suitable projects in future.</p>"
Azure functions,Platforms,Trial,TRUE,"<p><strong>Azure</strong> is gaining popularity especially in Germany and for some market segments even overtook AWS. <strong>Azure Functions</strong> is basic building block for serverless architectures and the equivalent to AWS Lambdas which we already have experience with.</p><p>Existing clients ask for Azure instead of AWS and after the improvements of Azure in the last two years it is a real alternativ for us.</p><p>We already have applications running at Azure and moving an application from AWS to Azure is straight forward we can directly trial that technology.</p>"
Public container services,Platforms,Assess,TRUE,"<p>For some scenarios we only need one <strong>docker container</strong> as part of a solution without the need for a full fledged Kubernetes cluster. Public cloud providers like <strong>AWS</strong> or <strong>Azure</strong> provide corresponding managed services (e.g. AWS Fargate or Azure Container Instances) that make it very easy to deploy just a single container without any concern for the underlying infrastructure.</p><p>Kubernetes is often to big and expensive of a solution for smaller applications. Here such services would be a great solution.</p><p>In a first step we should get an overview of the existing solutions and their pros and cons to assess the next promissing platform.</p>"
Node.js Express,Languages-and-Frameworks,Trial,TRUE,"<p><strong>Node.js Express</strong> is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications. It facilitates the rapid development of Node based Web applications.</p><p><strong>Node.js</strong> is lighter than Java and it is more handy once it comes to JSON. Also it gives VI more resource flexibility since we have javascript developers in Front-End team- we can use our Front-End team as well when resource needed for a Node.js project.</p><p>We already have AWS Lambda microservice written in Node.js and also tried a Node.js express application before. Setting up a Node.JS express application is stright forward with having javascript knowledge.</p>"
Quarkus,Languages-and-Frameworks,Assess,TRUE,"<p>Quarkus is a <strong>Kubernetes-native framework</strong> for Java applications development released by Red Hat. It’s based on <strong>container-first</strong> philosophy and has a very fast startup and low memory utilization. That’s achieved by using <strong>ahead-of-time compilation</strong> to avoid the runtime costs. Quarkus supports both imperative and reactive models. It  represents the new generation of Java frameworks which address startup performance and low memory consumption with combination of easy and fast development process. It's gained a lot of community attention and support a lot of libraries we already work with.</p><p>Consider existing VI competence in Java, cloud- and application response time reduction trends we can develop small and fast cloud-based services with Quarkus.</p><p>So it’s worth to take a closer look on it and assess.</p>"
Micronaut,Languages-and-Frameworks,Assess,TRUE,"<p>Micronaut is JVM framework for building services using <strong>Java</strong>, Kotlin or Groovy for building modular, easily testable microservice and serverless applications. A small memory footprint and short startup time is achived by DI/AOP container with performas dependency injection at compile time and run it as native machine code with GraalVM.</p><p>Consider existing VI competence in Java and SpringBoot Applications it's easy for us to step into.</p><p>So it’s worth to take a closer look on it and assess.</p>"
Helm,Tools,Assess,TRUE,"<p><strong>Helm</strong> is a package manager for Kubernetes. All components of a Kubernetes application and their interaction can be summarized and described in a so-called Helm Chart.</p><p>With Helm, complex Kubernetes applications, which consist of many Kubernetes components (Services, Controller, ConfigMaps, Secrets...), can be managed easier, because Helm reduces the complexity.</p><p>In the DEV community internally we have no experience with Helm. In the IFX context Thomas Hein is currently building the migration to Helm, but the project is only locally deployed.</p>"
Functional Programming in JS,Techniques,Adopt,TRUE,"<p><strong>Functional Programming</strong> or FP is a programming paradigm which favors functions as units in your code over classes/objects. This results in better testability and reusability</p>"
Mobile First,Techniques,Adopt,TRUE,"<p><strong>Mobile First</strong> is a method/concept to develop websites that are first and foremost optimized for the mobile web. We benefit from using <strong>Mobile First</strong>, because the use of websites shifts more and more towards mobile and we want to deliver an optimal experience for the user. Here at VI we are on the edge of adopting <strong>Mobile First</strong>, but to actually adopt it, in our opinion we need to embrace it in all our projects.</p>"
AWS,Platforms,Adopt,TRUE,"<p><strong>AWS</strong> is a collection of web services to do all kinds of serverless stuff.</p>"
Browser Dev Tools,Tools,Adopt,TRUE,"<p><strong>Dev tools</strong> in Firefox or Chrome are our tools as developers. So we should know them by heart to quickly find bugs and enhance user experience.</p>"
Invision,Tools,Adopt,TRUE,"<p><strong>Invision and Zeplin</strong> are tools to hand over designs to the developer. Included are spacings, assets, colors, typefaces etc. We benefit from using a tool like this in every project, because the communication/interface between design and dev will be noticeably optimized. Furthermore the exchange of design changes via pdf files and a versioning with pdf file names will be history.</p>"
Zeplin,Tools,Hold,TRUE,"<p><strong>Invision and Zeplin</strong> are tools to hand over designs to the developer. Included are spacings, assets, colors, typefaces etc. We benefit from using a tool like this in every project, because the communication/interface between design and dev will be noticeably optimized. Furthermore the exchange of design changes via pdf files and a versioning with pdf file names will be history.</p>"
Atomic Design,Techniques,Trial,TRUE,"<p><strong>Atomic Design</strong> is a method based on the idea that a design system and structure of components is similar to chemical elements. The advantage of this method is that different elements have a structured hierarchy, can be nested and used multiple times.</p>"
Web Animations,Techniques,Trial,TRUE,"<p><strong>Web Animations</strong> are an upcoming trend to enhance the user experience, by adding movement to web components. We benefit from using <strong>Web Animations</strong>, because we want to deliver a new visual experience for our clients websites and their users to e.g. seperate from competetors. At VI we use <strong>Web Animations</strong> in some projects already, but to grasp the whole potential and scope of the topic, we put it into the trial circle.</p>"
Google Structured Data,Techniques,Assess,TRUE,"<p><strong>Google Structured Data</strong>Google uses structured data that it finds on the web to understand the content of the page, as well as to gather information about the web and the world in general. We as Developers can use this data structure to improve SEO on a page as easy as possible (Job search, location pages).</p>"
Pa11y CLI,Tools,Assess,TRUE,"<p>The key to adopting a11y standards as an organization is to make catching accessibility errors a priority. This can be done using Pa11y CI, a command line version of the tool, as a gatekeeper to prevent inaccessible code from being checked into the code base. The benefit is to include a automated step in our workflow to raise awareness for accessability topics and shape the web accessible for everyone.</p>"
Biotope Quality Gate,Tools,Adopt,TRUE,"<p><strong>Biotope Quality Gate</strong> is a plugin for Biotope that is used for linting and which enforces a quality standard across the project.</p><p>By using BQG we would benefit by having a common project standard which reduces error proneness and time needed for code reviews.</p>"
Test Driven Development (TDD),Techniques,Adopt,TRUE,"<p><strong>Test Driven Development (TDD)</strong> is the practise of writing tests before or alongside the writing of actual code which enables you to write your code in a more structured manner and also see bugs immediately upon changing the code.</p><p>TDD would benefit us greatly by reducing error proneness. TDD helps to prevent breaking existing functionality and only develop what we really need.</p>"
Biotope Sketcher,Tools,Hold,TRUE,"<p><strong>Biotope Sketcher</strong> generates sketch files from existing design systems (frontend code), which designers could then use for further adjusting the designs of components.</p><p>This would benefit us by enforcing a one way direction of truth. When DEVs update the code, the design files automatically get updates as well.</p>"
Firebase,Tools,Adopt,TRUE,"<p>Firebase is Google's mobile platform that helps you quickly develop high-quality apps and grow your business.</p>"
PWA,Techniques,Adopt,TRUE,"<p>A progressive web application (PWA) is a type of application software delivered through the web, built using common web technologies including HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is intended to work on any platform that uses a standards-compliant browser.</p>"
JAMstack,Techniques,Assess,TRUE,"<p>JAMstack stands for JavaScript, APIs, and Markup. The term was coined by Mathias Biilmann to describe a modern web development architecture</p>"
