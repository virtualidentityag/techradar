Azure functions,Platforms,Trial,TRUE,"<p><strong>Azure</strong> is gaining popularity especially in Germany and for some market segments even overtook AWS. <strong>Azure Functions</strong> is basic building block for serverless architectures and the equivalent to AWS Lambdas whic hwe already have experience with.</p><p>Existing clients ask for Azure instead of AWS and after the improvements of Azure in the last two years it is a real alternativ for us.</p><p>We already have applications running at Azure and moving an application from AWS to Azure is straight forward we can directly trial that technology.</p>"
Public container services,Platforms,Assess,TRUE,"<p>For some scenarios we only need one <strong>docker container</strong> as part of a solution without the need for a full fledged Kubernetes cluster. Public cloud providers like <strong>AWS</strong> or <strong>Azure</strong> provide corresponding managed services (e.g. AWS Fargate or Azure Container Instances) that make it very easy to deploy just a single container without any concern for the underlying infrastructure.</p><p>Kubernetes is often to big and expensive of a solution for smaller applications. Here such services would be a great solution.</p><p>In a first step we should get an overview of the existing solutions and their pros and cons to assess the next promissing platform.</p>"
Python,languages-and-frameworks,Assess,TRUE,"<p><strong>Python</strong> is an established battle tested general purpose programming language which is well known for its clear, simple and concise syntax.</p><p>Python3 gained a lot of traction in the last years because of its strengths in the fields of machine learning and data analysis. One major benefit for us could be the very small footprint for serverless functions and the very fast cold start times compared to Java or node.js.</p><p>We have no experience with the language and should asses it in prototypical projects.</p>"
Java beyond 8,languages-and-frameworks,Trial,TRUE,"<p><strong>Java</strong> is the language of choice for us for building more complex applications or where a traditional Java-based CMS is used.</p><p>Java 8 is already aged but it is still the version we use in most active projects. LTS will eventually run out and we will have to update to more current versions. Besides that many new interresting features were introduced which could help us for simplicity, clarity or effectivness.</p><p>Since we know Java in general very well, we should directly use it in real projects to identify the real pros and cons of post version 8 features</p>"
