Azure functions,Platforms,Trial,TRUE,"<p><strong>Azure</strong> is gaining popularity especially in Germany and for some market segments even overtook AWS. <strong>Azure Functions</strong> is basic building block for serverless architectures and the equivalent to AWS Lambdas whic hwe already have experience with.</p><p>Existing clients ask for Azure instead of AWS and after the improvements of Azure in the last two years it is a real alternativ for us.</p><p>We already have applications running at Azure and moving an application from AWS to Azure is straight forward we can directly trial that technology.</p>"
Public container services,Platforms,Assess,TRUE,"<p>For some scenarios we only need one <strong>docker container</strong> as part of a solution without the need for a full fledged Kubernetes cluster. Public cloud providers like <strong>AWS</strong> or <strong>Azure</strong> provide corresponding managed services (e.g. AWS Fargate or Azure Container Instances) that make it very easy to deploy just a single container without any concern for the underlying infrastructure.</p><p>Kubernetes is often to big and expensive of a solution for smaller applications. Here such services would be a great solution.</p><p>In a first step we should get an overview of the existing solutions and their pros and cons to assess the next promissing platform.</p>"
Python,Languages-and-frameworks,Assess,TRUE,"<p><strong>Python</strong> is an established battle tested general purpose programming language which is well known for its clear, simple and concise syntax.</p><p>Python3 gained a lot of traction in the last years because of its strengths in the fields of machine learning and data analysis. One major benefit for us could be the very small footprint for serverless functions and the very fast cold start times compared to Java or node.js.</p><p>We have no experience with the language and should asses it in prototypical projects.</p>"
Java beyond 8,Languages-and-frameworks,Trial,TRUE,"<p><strong>Java</strong> is the language of choice for us for building more complex applications or where a traditional Java-based CMS is used.</p><p>Java 8 is already aged but it is still the version we use in most active projects. LTS will eventually run out and we will have to update to more current versions. Besides that many new interresting features were introduced which could help us for simplicity, clarity or effectivness.</p><p>Since we know Java in general very well, we should directly use it in real projects to identify the real pros and cons of post version 8 features</p>"
Node.js Express,Languages-and-frameworks,Trial,TRUE,"<p><strong>Node.js Express</strong> is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications. It facilitates the rapid development of Node based Web applications.</p><p><strong>Node.js</strong> is lighter than Java and it is more handy once it comes to JSON. Also it gives VI more resource flexibility since we have javascript developers in Front-End team- we can use our Front-End team as well when resource needed for a Node.js project.</p><p>We already have AWS Lambda microservice written in Node.js and also tried a Node.js express application before. Setting up a Node.JS express application is stright forward with having javascript knowledge.</p>"
Quarkus,Languages-and-frameworks,Assess,TRUE,"<p>Quarkus is a <strong>Kubernetes-native framework</strong> for Java applications development released by Red Hat. It’s based on <strong>container-first</strong> philosophy and has a very fast startup and low memory utilization. That’s achieved by using <strong>ahead-of-time compilation</strong> to avoid the runtime costs. Quarkus supports both imperative and reactive models. It  represents the new generation of Java frameworks which address startup performance and low memory consumption with combination of easy and fast development process. It's gained a lot of community attention and support a lot of libraries we already work with.</p><p>Consider existing VI competence in Java, cloud- and application response time reduction trends we can develop small and fast cloud-based services with Quarkus.</p><p>So it’s worth to take a closer look on it and assess.</p>"
Micronaut,Languages-and-frameworks,Assess,TRUE,"<p>Micronaut is JVM framework for building services using <strong>Java</strong>, Kotlin or Groovy for building modular, easily testable microservice and serverless applications. A small memory footprint and short startup time is achived by DI/AOP container with performas dependency injection at compile time and run it as native machine code with GraalVM.</p><p>Consider existing VI competence in Java and SpringBoot Applications it's easy for us to step into.</p><p>So it’s worth to take a closer look on it and assess.</p>"
Machine Learning,Techniques,Assess,TRUE,"<p>Machine Learning is on everyone's lips and there are certainly many concrete topics we could note down, but we lack the general knowledge of what we can do with this trend and we are not able to provide information when talking to customers.</p><p>We as VI will probably not develop ML services, but we want to be able to use them.</p><p>For this purpose, a concrete use case would be helpful to get a feeling for the topic and also to be able to give a more confident figure in customer questions.</p>"
Kubernetes,Tools,Adopt,TRUE,"<p><strong>Kubernetes (K8s)</strong> is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.</p><p>It helps us to deploy, manage and automate applications that consist of a set of services. Without this support and automation, managing containerized applications becomes more difficult the more services the application contains.</p><p>We successfully use Kubernetes in the Siedle projects. A migration to Kubernetes is currently being carried out for Infineon.We therefore intend to use Kubernetes in principle for suitable projects in future.</p>"
Helm,Tools,Assess,TRUE,"<p><strong>Helm</strong> is a package manager for Kubernetes. All components of a Kubernetes application and their interaction can be summarized and described in a so-called Helm Chart.</p><p>With Helm, complex Kubernetes applications, which consist of many Kubernetes components (Services, Controller, ConfigMaps, Secrets...), can be managed easier, because Helm reduces the complexity.</p><p>In the DEV community internally we have no experience with Helm.In the IFX context Thomas Hein is currently building the migration to Helm, but the project is only locally deployed.</p>"
