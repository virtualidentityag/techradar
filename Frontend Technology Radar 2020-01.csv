Puppeteer,languages-and-frameworks,Adopt,TRUE,"<p><strong>Puppeteer</strong> provides an API to control a (headless) Chrome.</p><p>Developers are able to generate screenshots and PDFs of pages, crawl their contents and automate keyboard input, form submission and more.</p><p>Puppeteer can help to automate UI testing and offers some nice-to-have features, which can ease the daily life of developers.</p><p>We use Puppeteer in (at least) two website projects for the processing and rendering of static pages.</p>"
GraphQL,languages-and-frameworks,Adopt,TRUE,"<p><strong>GraphQL</strong> is a language for querying databases from client-side applications and offers an alternative to the usage of RESTful APIs.</p><p>Developers are able to make precise data requests and obtain no more and no less, but exactly what they need.</p><p>This reduces network traffic and makes the developer's life easier, since he knows what data he can expect and work with.</p><p>We could already evaluate GraphQL in a strategic project and decided that we can profit from it.</p>"
Node.js,languages-and-frameworks,Adopt,TRUE,"<p>dummy</p>"
Biotope Quality Gate,Tools,Adopt,TRUE,"<p><strong>Biotope Quality Gate</strong> is a plugin for Biotope that is used for linting and which enforces a quality standard across the project.</p><p>By using BQG we would benefit by having a common project standard which reduces error proneness and time needed for code reviews.</p>"
Test Driven Development (TDD),Techniques,Adopt,TRUE,"<p><strong>Test Driven Development (TDD)</strong> is the practise of writing tests before or alongside the writing of actual code which enables you to write your code in a more structured manner and also see bugs immediately upon changing the code.</p><p>TDD would benefit us greatly by reducing error proneness.</p>"
Biotope Sketcher,Tools,Trial,TRUE,"<p><strong>Biotope Sketcher</strong> generates sketch files from existing design systems (frontend code), which designers could then use for further adjusting the designs of components.</p><p>This would benefit us by enforcing a one way direction of truth. When DEVs update the code, the design files automatically get updates as well.</p>"
Jest Testing Framework,languages-and-frameworks,Trial,TRUE,"<p><strong>Jest</strong> is an open source Javascript testing framework focusing on simplicity. It works out of the box, is mostly config-free and does not require additional assertion libraries. Jest is used by Facebook for react, but can be used for any JavaScript, Typescript or Nodejs project.</p><p>With Jest it’s easier and faster to write tests than with Mocha and Chai.<p>We could profit from reduced efforts in setting-up and maintaining the testing framework and more efficiently writing tests.</p><p>Jest already is used and proven beneficial in existing VI projects like Neoperl.</p>"
ES Modules & CDN,languages-and-frameworks,Assess,TRUE,"<p><strong>ES Modules</strong>: Currently, most of the browsers already support the use of ES modules. And, of course, Node.js couldn’t stay back and now fully supports ECMAScript modules as they are currently specified and provides limited interoperability between them and the existing module format, CommonJS. ECMAScript modules are the official standard format to package JavaScript code for reuse. Modules are defined using a variety of import and export statements.</p><p><strong>Dynamic imports</strong> This feature solves a lot of headaches and waste of money related to the app’s performance. It helps to, and allows to, load modules dynamically. In other words, on-demand by using promises or the async/await syntax</p>"
Web Assembly,languages-and-frameworks,Assess,TRUE,"<p><strong>Web Assembly (Wasm)</strong> can reduce quite a bit the battery consumption on mobile devices (depending on the engine), since most of the processing steps have been completed ahead of time during compilation. With Web Assembly, we’ll be able to push some of the heaviest processing and rendering into a language that is better suited for the job.</p><p>The Wasm stack machine is designed to be encoded in a size- and load-time-efficient binary format which may save loading times.</p>"
Houdini,languages-and-frameworks,Assess,TRUE,"<p><strong>Houdini</strong> gives developers access to the CSS object model (CSSOM) for the very first time. Instead of updating styles in JavaScript, developers can write code that the browser understands and can parse as CSS!</p>"
Platforms,Platforms,Hold,FALSE,"<p>dummy</p>"
Vue.JS,languages-and-frameworks,Adopt,FALSE,"<p>Vue is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable.</p>"
React,languages-and-frameworks,Adopt,FALSE,"<p>React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.</p>"
Functional Programing,Techniques,Adopt,TRUE,"<p>In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.</p>"
Firebase,Tools,Adopt,TRUE,"<p>Firebase is Google's mobile platform that helps you quickly develop high-quality apps and grow your business.</p>"
PWA,Techniques,Adopt,TRUE,"<p>A progressive web application (PWA) is a type of application software delivered through the web, built using common web technologies including HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is intended to work on any platform that uses a standards-compliant browser.</p>"
RxJS,languages-and-frameworks,Trial,TRUE,"<p>RxJS is a library for reactive programming using Observables, to make it easier to compose asynchronous or callback-based code.</p>"
JAM stack,Techniques,Assess,TRUE,"<p>JAMstack stands for JavaScript, APIs, and Markup. The term was coined by Mathias Biilmann to describe a modern web development architecture</p>"
