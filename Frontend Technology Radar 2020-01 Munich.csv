TDD,Techniques,Adopt,TRUE,"<p><strong>TDD</strong> allows us to prevent breaking existing functionality and just develop what we really need to by writing tests firsts and functionality afterwards.</p>"
Functional Programming,Techniques,Adopt,TRUE,"<p><strong>Functional Programming</strong> or FP is a programming paradigm which favors functions as units in your code over classes/objects. This results in better testability and reusability</p>"
Mobile First,Techniques,Adopt,TRUE,"<p><strong>Mobile First</strong> is a method/concept to develop websites that are first and foremost optimized for the mobile web. We benefit from using <strong>Mobile First</strong>, because the use of websites shifts more and more towards mobile and we want to deliver an optimal experience for the user. Here at VI we are on the edge of adopting <strong>Mobile First</strong>, but to actually adopt it, in our opinion we need to embrace it in all our projects.</p>"
AWS,Platforms,Adopt,TRUE,"<p><strong>AWS</strong> is a collection of web services to do all kinds of serverless stuff.</p>"
Dev Tools,Tools,Adopt,TRUE,"<p><strong>Dev tools</strong> in Firefox or Chrome are our tools as developers. So we should know them by heart to quickly find bugs and enhance user experience.</p>"
Invision/Zeplin,Tools,Adopt,TRUE,"<p><strong>Invision and Zeplin</strong> are tools to hand over designs to the developer. Included are spacings, assets, colors, typefaces etc. We benefit from using a tool like this in every project, because the communication/interface between design and dev will be noticeably optimized. Furthermore the exchange of design changes via pdf files and a versioning with pdf file names will be history.</p>"
Atomic Design,Techniques,Trial,TRUE,"<p><strong>Atomic Design</strong> is a method based on the idea that a design system and structure of components is similar to chemical elements. The advantage of this method is that different elements have a structured hierarchy, can be nested and used multiple times.</p>"
Web Animations,Techniques,Trial,TRUE,"<p><strong>Web Animations</strong> are an upcoming trend to enhance the user experience, by adding movement to web components. We benefit from using <strong>Web Animations</strong>, because we want to deliver a new visual experience for our clients websites and their users to e.g. seperate from competetors. At VI we use <strong>Web Animations</strong> in some projects already, but to grasp the whole potential and scope of the topic, we put it into the trial circle.</p>"
Google Structured Data,Techniques,Assess,TRUE,"<p><strong>Google Structured Data</strong>Google uses structured data that it finds on the web to understand the content of the page, as well as to gather information about the web and the world in general.

Pa11y CLI,Tools,Assess,TRUE,"<p>The key to adopting a11y standards as an organization is to make catching accessibility errors a priority. This can be done using Pa11y CI, a command line version of the tool, as a gatekeeper to prevent inaccessible code from being checked into the code base. The benefit is to include a automated step in our workflow to raise awareness for accessability topics and shape the web accessible for everyone.</p>"
